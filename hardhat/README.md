# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a myListed for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat myListed
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat myListed
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
